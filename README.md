```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd employee-management-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash

npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/employee_management

mongod

# Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
# Update MONGODB_URI in .env file
```

### 5. Start the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```
This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and frontend development server (port 3000) concurrently.

#### Manual Start
